The folders in the current repository contain files written in C for PIC16F877A.
Each of them was special developed for a certain type of motor, but all of them use the same eletronic board.
The project of the eletronic board is presented in the current folder.

The folder RobotArmSim contains a MatLab file that simulates the behaviour of a robot arm.

The main purpose of this repository is to create a 3D printed version of a robot arm using C language.
