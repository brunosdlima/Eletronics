This matlab script simulates a robot arm consisted of 3 four bar linakge. Three
different modules are available. If the variable video is set to 1, a
video with the possible positions will be shown. If the variable image is
set to 1, an image will be generated with the possible positions marked as
red '*'. If position is set to 1 a desired position will be required and 
the algorithm will calculate the necessary angles to achieve this position.
